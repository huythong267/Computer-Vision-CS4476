I have implemented the Harris Corner detector, Adaptive Non-Maximal Supression, SIFT desciptor, and Feature Matching.

Combining these algorithms, the accuracy on the Notre Dame is 93%.

For extra credit, I did 2 optional taskes:      
(1) Local feature matching bells and whistles: Comparing timing difference on 3+1 Feature Matching algorithms.     
(2) Local feature description bells and whistles: Sweeping the feature window to see that feature_window = 16 achieves good performance in both accuracy and computation time.
