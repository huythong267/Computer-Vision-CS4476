I have implemeted all the problem.

Baseline case without amending any codes: 36% accuracy
When jittering and adding BatchNorm, Dropout, CNN: 60% accuracy
With AlexNet and transfer learning: 85% accuracy

All the write-up has been reported with screen-captured from visdom.

I implemented 2 extra credits:
(1) Build the saliency map to show the part of the image with strongest gradient
(2) Visualize the feature extractions from AlexNet CNN layers
