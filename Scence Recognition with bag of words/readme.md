All the functions have been implemented. 
All the experiement designs have been analyzed, including cross-validation, tuning hyper parameters of SVC, and vocab_size.

I have done 2 extra credits:

(1) Train SVM with 'RBF, Poly, Sigmoid' kernel. Accuracy can achieved 70%.

(2) Implemented the 'kernal codebook encoding'. Experiment the various hyperparameter value for soft assigment on the data.
